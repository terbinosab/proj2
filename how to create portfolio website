There are two main approaches to creating a portfolio website: using a website builder or coding it yourself.

Website Builders:

This is a great option for those with no coding experience or who want a quick and easy solution. Website builders offer pre-designed templates that you can customize with your own content, images, and colors.  Some popular website builders for portfolios include Wix, Squarespace, and Canva.

Coding Your Own Website:

This approach gives you more flexibility and control over the look and feel of your website. However, it requires some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. If you're interested in learning to code, there are many free resources available online, such as tutorials and courses. You can also use a platform like GitHub Pages to host your website for free.
